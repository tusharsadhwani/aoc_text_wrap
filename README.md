# aoc_text_wrap

Automatic text wrapper I wrote for Advent of Code.

It reads a text file, and wraps all text in it to a line width of 72 characters.

I use it to format AoC problems to python docstrings for [my solutions repo][1].

I also use it for [Daily Byte][2].

## Usage:

```console
python textwrap.py path/to/file.py
```
