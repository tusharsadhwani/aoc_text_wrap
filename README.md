# pytextwrap

Wraps your text files to a given width, without breaking words.

It reads a text file, and wraps all text in it to a line width of 72 characters.

I use it to format AoC problems to python docstrings for [my solutions repo][1].

I also use it for [Daily Byte][2].

## Installation

```console
pip install pytextwrap
```

## Usage

```console
textwrap path/to/file
```
